                Blue Blood is an album released by X on April 21, 1989. It contains re-recordings of tracks from the band's debut album Vanishing Vision, "KURENAI" and "UN-FINISHED…" (both with alternate/expanded lyrics/different track names) and leans more towards symphonic rock than its predecessor ("ROSE OF PAIN" includes portions from J.S. Bach's "Fugue in G Minor"). Several songs from the record remained mainstays in X JAPAN's live sets. Remastered editions of Blue Blood and the album Jealousy were released on February 14, 2007, each including a bonus CD with instrumental versions of X JAPAN songs.

                ART OF LIFE is an album released by X Japan on August 28, 1993. It consists of only one song of the same name, which is nearly 29 minutes long, and was written and composed by Yoshiki Hayashi. The heavily orchestrated piece (recorded with the London Royal Philharmonic Orchestra) is partly based on Schubert's unfinished Symphony No. 8 and comprises several passages of varying speed and instrumentation, including eight minutes performed solely on piano
