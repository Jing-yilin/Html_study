                Blue Blood is an album released by X on April 21, 1989. It contains re-recordings of tracks from the band's debut album Vanishing Vision, "KURENAI" and "UN-FINISHEDâ€¦" (both with alternate/expanded lyrics/different track names) and leans more towards symphonic rock than its predecessor ("ROSE OF PAIN" includes portions from J.S. Bach's "Fugue in G Minor"). Several songs from the record remained mainstays in X JAPAN's live sets. Remastered editions of Blue Blood and the album Jealousy were released on February 14, 2007, each including a bonus CD with instrumental versions of X JAPAN songs.
